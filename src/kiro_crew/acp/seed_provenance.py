"""Durable provenance for the ``settings.local.json`` seed Crew writes.

Crew seeds ``<work_dir>/.claude/settings.local.json`` for a claude-agent-acp
session and overwrites or removes ONLY the file it owns. Proving that ownership
from per-instance memory alone ("this client created it" plus "the bytes it
wrote") answers the question correctly inside one session and wrongly outside
one: a seed left behind by a session that was killed, or by an earlier app
version, reads as a stranger's file forever after. The writer then
takes its leave-it-alone branch on every subsequent session, so a stale
``availableModels`` allowlist (and a stale ``permissions.defaultMode``, up to an
inherited ``bypassPermissions``) becomes permanent project state that Crew can
neither refresh nor clean up.

This module is the missing half: a small record, under Crew's OWN data home, of
the bytes Crew last wrote to a given settings path. It is a **provenance
credential, not a permission grant** — a record alone proves nothing, because
adoption additionally requires the file on disk to still hash to the recorded
digest. A user-authored file (or a Crew file the user has since edited) never
matches, so it is still left untouched; only Crew's own orphan is recognized and
re-seeded.

Four properties the callers depend on:

* **Nothing is added to the user's project.** The record lives beside Crew's
  other sidecars in ``config_dir()``, keyed by the settings path, so a checked-out
  repository gains no extra file to notice, ignore or commit.
* **Lookups never touch the disk, and no mutation runs on the event loop.**
  Ownership is consulted synchronously from teardown, so the sidecar is read once
  at import and served from memory afterwards. Durable mutations write and are
  therefore blocking; each runs off-loop. :func:`release_local` and
  :func:`unshare_local` are the memory-only counterparts teardown may call
  directly after the off-loop discard handles durable holder withdrawal.
* **Every failure answers "not ours".** An unreadable or corrupt sidecar, a
  missing entry, a malformed entry — all degrade to the pre-existing behaviour of
  leaving the file alone, which is the safe direction.
* **A record is adoptable only once nobody here still holds it.** Ownership is
  scoped to an owner token, so an orphan is adopted by the next session while a
  path a LIVE client in this process is seeding stays that client's own.

The sharer registry (:func:`share` / :func:`unshare` / :func:`has_sharers`)
interleaves with the owner lifecycle in ``acp/client.py``; these are the
invariants both modules hold together, each backed by a review ruling on the
PR that introduced it:

* **Byte-equality is the share boundary.** A session becomes a sharer only
  when the payload it would write is byte-identical to the file on disk.
* **Only the owner writes.** A sharer never writes, claims, or deletes the
  settings file; authorship under a live sharer additionally requires the new
  payload to be byte-identical to the recorded digest (:func:`recorded_any`).
* **A lease is withdrawn only by its own sharer's reset** — or by promotion
  to ownership, the single authorship point.
* **A record a live sharer validated survives every prune** until that
  sharer's reset (:func:`_persist` exempts keys with live sharers).
* **Records are invisible until durable.** :func:`record` publishes in memory
  only after its persist lands, so a rider never trusts bytes whose grant
  could vanish in a crash.
* **Owner teardown keeps the file under live sharers** and hands back only
  its own slot; the next session adopts and repairs the recorded orphan.

# it is non-empty, the owner's teardown leaves the file in place (see the
# client's settle transaction) and :func:`claim` refuses a new adoption, so no
# Crew session can put DIFFERENT permission bytes at a path a sharer already
# delivered tools against. Like ``_LIVE`` it is the in-process cache: each
# lease is also persisted as a ``holders`` entry on the sidecar record, so a

    which is cheap and keeps the sidecar honest about the digest. *owner* is also
    claimed as the path's LIVE holder, so a sibling client in this process reads it
    as somebody's live seed rather than as an orphan.

    The return value is the same contract :func:`forget` carries, and for the same

    write did not land, this process's records are exactly what a restart would
    read, and **the caller must not leave a seed behind** — a settings file with no
    durable grant is a ``permissions.defaultMode`` the user never approved that no
    later session is permitted to re-seed or remove, so it outlives every session on
    the host. Withdrawing the seed is the only outcome that stays inside this
    module's invariant, which is why this is not best-effort.

    **The entry reaches ``_RECORDS`` only once the sidecar write has landed.** The
    lock-free readers -- :func:`share` above all -- see ``_RECORDS`` at any instant,
    and an entry published before the persist would let a sibling validate a share
    against a grant that then fails: a governed reader left on a file no later
    session can recognize. Publishing after means a failing persist is invisible --
    on a re-seed the previous durable entry simply stays in place, still naming the
